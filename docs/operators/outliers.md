# Outliers operation

The Outliers operation in DocETL removes outliers from the input (or
keeps only outliers).

## ðŸš€ Example: 

```yaml
- name: remove-worst-10
  type: outliers
  samples: 0.9
  embedding_keys:
   - concept
   - description
```

This will keep the 90 percent closest to the center (average)
embedding of the keys provided. Altermnatively, you could set samples
to an integer count of items to keep (or a negative number to throw
away). You can also assume a gaussian distribution and set the key std
to a number of standard deviations out from the center, instead of
setting samples.

Small note about embeddings: If you embed too short values, some
embedding models will yield a very "sparse" distribution, where the
absolute majority of points lie on the surface of a hyperssphere,
meaning that this operation will not work very well!

### Using it as a poor-mans-RAG
```yaml
- name: remove-worst-10
  type: outliers
  samples: 0.01
  embedding_keys:
   - concept
   - description
  center:
    concept: Horse
    description: A horse is a large steppe roaming and grazing animal. Humans have utilized horses for transport throughout historical times
```

If center is provided, it must have the same keys as those listed
under embedding_keys, and their values will be used to calculate the
"center" embedding, instead of using the average of all embeddings of
the input items. This will effectively turn this into a search
operation for items similar to the center provided.

## Required Parameters

- `name`: A unique name for the operation.
- `type`: Must be set to "sample".
- `samples`: Either a an integer count of samples, or a float fraction of samples.
- `embedding_keys`: A list of keys to use for the embedding distance calculation.

## Optional Parameters

| Parameter                 | Description                                                                      | Default                       |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| `keep`                    | If set to true, return the outliers instead of the non-outliers | false
| `center`                  | An explicit center object to be used to calculate the center embedding instead of using the average | The average embedding of all input data
